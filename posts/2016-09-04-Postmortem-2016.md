A summary of our solutions, our problems, and what we see moving forward.

As I promised [last time](http://www.ascendntnu.no/iarc/competition/2016/08/28/Retrospect-2016.html), this week will be less about the people involved, and more about the technology --- the code, the algorithms and the logarithms. In this flabbergasting whirlwind technical rundown, you get to read about the system we ended up with at, as well as a few nuggets of wisdom that we decided to share with you.

Some of those nuggets fall into the *best practices* notebook that we all keep close to our heart, and includes things like: printing a warning message if a script uses default values for commandline arguments - because the user (that could be you) *will* forget to pass those, and will spend unecessary time debugging a problem.

Others involve *communication* and taking the time to share knowledge. For example, as a programmer you spend a lot of time doing things on your own. So you might write a small one-off tool or some piece of code that helps you with a problem, but without *sharing* that knowledge with the rest of the team, someone else might duplicate the work, not realizing that you had already done it.

Anyway, we wrote a detailed summary of all the things we learned and the problems we see for the next year. Brew some tea, get some snacks, and enjoy.
