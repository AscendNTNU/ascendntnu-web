Ascend is a new aerial robotics team from [NTNU], established to represent [NTNU] in the annual [International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC)][IARC]. After using the spring to gather a team, we are now very exited to start on our first IARC-mission.

We discovered [IARC] april this year, and quickly started to gather a team. Currently we are 11 students from [Computer science][data] and [Cybernetics and Robotics][kyb].

The project has gotten very positive feedback from our faculties, the [Departement of Computer and Information Science][IDI] and the [Departement of Engineering Cybernetcs][ITK]. Many of us will write project theses geared towards [IARC]. The faculties have also been very kind in giving us access to labs at NTNU dedicated to working with UAVs. Starting in August, the UAV-lab at the roof of the Elektro-building at campus will be our main hangout.

We are using the summer for planning, research and other preparations before project kick off as soon as the semester starts in August. We will attend our first competition in 2016.

This website will be updated with more info about us and our progress as the project moves foreward, so stay tuned.

_PS: While we won't attend any competitions this summer, our friends in [Revolve] are representing [NTNU] in [formula student] with their amazing electric racing car Vilje. Check it out on [their website][Revolve]._
