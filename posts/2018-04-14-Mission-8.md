This summer will be the last year that the International Aerial Robotic Competition (IARC) will run mission 7. This is because several competitors are expected to solve mission 7 this summer. Last summer a team in the Asian venue managed to get three ground robots out of the course. To win the competition you have to get at least four ground robots out of the course.

IARC has therefore released Mission 8. The mission is for a human person to retrieve objects from bins that are located on the course. While the person is trying to do this, they will be attacked by flying enemy drones. If they are hit ten times, they will lose. The person will have help from up to four helper drones. These drones will be able to scout the course, so the person knows where both the object, and the enemy drones are located. The helper drones are also able to heal the person.

IARC have also made an informational video explaining both the story behind the mission as well as the mission itself.
